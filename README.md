## Introduction

To properly handle real scenarios, we construct a new dataset called Real Scenario Text-based Person Re-identification (RSTPReid) based on [MSMT17](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Wei_Person_Transfer_GAN_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) [2]. RSTPReid contains 20505 images of 4,101 persons from 15 cameras. Each person has 5 corresponding images taken by different cameras with complex both indoor and outdoor scene transformations and backgrounds in various periods of time, which makes RSTPReid much more challenging and more adaptable to real scenarios. Each image is annotated with 2 textual descriptions. For data division, 3701, 200 and 200 identities are utilized for training, validation and testing, respectively. Each sentence is no shorter than 23 words. After dropping words that appear less than twice, the word number is 2204.
